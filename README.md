# pong-c
Kieran's Pong clone written in C using [RayLib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

## Building
### Makefile (Recommended)
Run make "windows", "linux", or "macos" to compile for your platform. Binaries are outputted to the builds/ directory and are statically linked to libraylib.a.

### Codeblocks project (Not recommended)
You could also use my the codeblocks project, however this has only been tested on Windows.

##Building
###Recommended method via Makefile
Run make "windows", make "linux" or make macosx" to compile for your platform, builds are in the makebuilds/ directory.
###Codeblocks project
Although mainly for my convenience and not recommended, you can try to use the codeblocks project on your computer, howver I havent tested if it works on other PCs.
